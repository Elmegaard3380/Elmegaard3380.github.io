    <h2>What problems, decisions, actions by the United Nations seemed to make the situation worse? Why were those decisions made?</h2>

    </div>
    <div class="text">
        <p>The United Nations lack of serious action in the earlier stages of the war were one of their main flaws when it comes to their action or in this case lack of actions taken when it comes to their intervention. </p>
       <br>
       <p>One of the main and most notable actions that the UN took that seemed to make the situation worse was their protection of the city of Srebrenica. The city of Srebrenica was a refugee protected city by 600 dutch UN forces and the people were promised by the UN to be protected from the Serbs. The soldiers were young and inexperienced as the UN thought that this would be enough to deter the Serbs. </p>
       <br>
       <p> At this time the people knew that the Serbs were hunting and killing muslim people and they thought that they were safe under UN protection, but they were wrong. The UN was convinced by the Serbs to release some of their control on the city when they were threatened because the Serbs had UN soldier prisoners. It was easy for the Serbs to overpower the city and there was no fight to stop them from coming in. </p>
       <br>
       <p>The Serbs began ravaging the city. Women and children were raped and killed. The most bloodshed occured when the Serbs ordered all the men to separate from their families and come to be transported from the city. They took these men and systematically killed them which resulted in the mass murder of over 7000 muslim men, some as young as 12. Around 23 000 women and children were also deported, and many were raped.</p>
       <br>
       <p> The worst part about the UN soldiers actions was the fact that not only did they not protect the city from Serb control, but they actually helped the Serb forces separate men and women before the massacre. Although the peacekeepers did not know they were leading the men away to their deaths they were taking part in what would become the worst mass murder on european soild since world war 2.</p>
       <br>
       <p>This was one of the biggest failures by the UN in the history of the organisation. Soldiers stood by as Serbian soldiers pillaged and raped the city. One of the most shocking and notable actions by the UN was the actions of general Philippe Marillon. The general entered the city and promised the people safety in a famous quote “You are now under the protection of the UN forces. I will never abandon you.”. This of course was not true as the city was taken with no effort to defend it.
