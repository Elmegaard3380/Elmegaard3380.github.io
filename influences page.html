            <h3>Taken Influences:</h3>
            <p>I enjoy working with image editing programs on my free time like Photoshop, paint and others.  I have also begun to work with graphic designs programs, allowing me to work on both 2d and 3d graphics.  I'm interested in this topic as it let's me use my creativity and merge it with technology that I can then integrate to things like games, websites or other projects </p>

            <h3>Taken Influences:</h3>
            <p>I enjoy both messing around within virtual reality and learning about the technology itself.  I'm super interested in learning to make more immersersive expriences for my players or viewers, providing fully detailed 360 enviroments.

            <ul>
                <p>I enjoy having a goal, and I find the field of Cybersecurity provides ton of them.  When it either comes to designing new programs to aid making work more efficient, protecting data or even code to break other programs. I just find it would be an interesing field to be apart ofand it would provide a lot of experience in many areas of computer science. </p>

            <h3>Taken Influences:</h3>
            <p>I am someone that enjoys tabletop games for the sake of being able to tell a story, translating that into a game onto someones screen is right up my alley.  Plus this allows me to work with a bunchof new programs and game egines when putting my game together.  Plus I also gain more experience when coding when i put these  games together,often due to bug fixing and troubleshooting.  That often leads to build stronger code thatcan be applied elsewhere </p>
