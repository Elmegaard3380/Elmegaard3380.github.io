    <h2>(How) was global intervention effective or not? </h2>

    <p>It is clear global was non-effective in this case, and often made things worse or allowed this genocide carried on for as long as it needed to.  One of the main issues was actually their lack of their involvement, as the UN and many international leaders wanted to avoid conflict with the Serbs at all cost.  As waging a war against them could affect everything trade, to humanitarian actions to even peace negotiations.</p>
    <br>
    <p>So the global intervention was simply limited to humanitarian aid and peacekeepers, that were told not to engage or participate in any of these conflicts between the Serbs and the Muslims. These individuals were practically there  to watch these atrocities occur as women and children got slaughtered and raped, as they were ordered not to get involved.   As seen in Srebrenica, when UN soldiers were forced aside as the Serbs laid waste to the city, leading to the death of thousands.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This intervention wasn’t enough, as higher focus was focused on bureaucracy rather than the people of Bosnia themselves, which is why international involvement in this time of crisis was both half-thought out and scarce. As if the UN had decided to intervene right away, sending troops in to push back Serb forces and protect civilians, thousands of lives could have been saved and massacres such as the one in Srebrenica could have been avoided.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It also took time to hold individuals accountable for this genocide responsible and trial them accordingly. Ratko Mladić, the man who led the Serb forces during the Bosnian war was only officially sentenced to life in prison for his war crimes in 2017, twenty two years after the end Bosnian genocide.  This slow involvement failed victims and survivors again, this man who was nicknamed the Butcher of Bosnia got to walk free for 22 years after the atrocities he commited or pushed to have happened.  Though actually making him accountable for these crimes against humanity and these atrocities was a good first step at fixing the mess they partly created, it doesn’t make it completely disappear, though it does give some justice for the victims and survivors.</p>
