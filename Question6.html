    <p>After the Dayton Peace agreement in 1995, which gave 51% of the country to 51% of the country to Croat-Muslim federation and 49% to the Serb republic, so this day, Bosnia is one of the few countries that is heavily divided.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Due to the the International Criminal Tribunal being put in place while the genocide was still occuring in 1993, after that date and past the end of the war in 1995, many Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats who were involved in the genocide have been convicted. Large names such as Radovan Karadizic and Ratko Mladic are amongst those convicted, however it’s surprising to see that they’ve been convicted within the last 10 years and not directly after (Karadzic in 2016, Mladic in 2017).</p>  
    <br>
    <p>Around the time of August in 2019, they’re were still 250 war crimes from the Bosnian genocide that was yet to be put into action. Even thought a peace agreement was made in 1995, there’s still always tension since all the groups are still fairly divided, however it is refreshing to see that in 2019, Bosnia, Serbia and Croatia signed an agreement to have more cooperation between themselves in the search of 12 000 people still missing from the Yugoslavia war.</p>
   <br>
   <p>Psychologically, this war is still present in everyone's mind considering it was only 28 years ago, as it’s been reported that about 4000 soldiers who were involved in the war have committed suicide from 1995 to 2011. </p>
