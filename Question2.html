        <h3>Ethnic cleansing</h3>
        <img src="ethnic cleansing v2.jpg" style="margin-left: 26rem; margin-top: 1rem; border: solid;  border-color: #ffcc00;">
        <p>Ethnic cleansing is the assimilation/removal of ethnic/racial/religious groups from an area attempting to make the ethnically homogenous. Ethnic cleansing is the expulsion of a group in a certain area, while genocide is the elimination of an entire group. </p>
        <br>
        <p>We call it “ethnic cleansing” rather than genocide because although it is the elimination of a group, the goal is to “cleanse” the area of the minor religions/races, which is essentially a more specific term for genocide if the intentions are to destroy the group. The implications of this discourse matter because of the difference between genocides and ethnic cleansing. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Calling the Bosnian genocide “ethnic cleansing” would make the massacre seem less severe than using the term “genocide”. In 2007, ICJ concluded that the Bosnian Genocide case was a genocide. They noted that there was much evidence of murder, rape, and torture. They decided that Serbia had not committed the genocide, but they failed to prevent it in Srebrenica.
